Image Segmentation Pipeline
This project aims to implement a straightforward image segmentation pipeline to classify the foreground (object) and background regions in images. Segmentation is essential in computer vision tasks like object detection, medical imaging, and autonomous driving, where identifying and separating objects within a scene is crucial. This project demonstrates the fundamental steps of creating and training a segmentation model for binary classification (foreground vs. background).

Project Overview
Data Loading: The pipeline begins by loading a small, labeled dataset, consisting of images and corresponding binary segmentation masks. Each mask highlights the object regions in white (foreground) and the background in black, forming a basis for the model’s learning process.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing includes resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and applying augmentations (e.g., flipping, scaling) to improve model generalization. The preprocessing pipeline prepares the images and masks for efficient model training.

Model Setup: A simple convolutional neural network (CNN)-based segmentation model is built. This model leverages convolutional layers to capture spatial features, enabling it to learn and recognize object regions effectively. The model architecture is kept minimal for easy experimentation and quick training.

Training and Evaluation: The model is trained using the preprocessed data, learning to differentiate between foreground and background pixels. After training, the model's performance is evaluated by making predictions on test images and comparing them with the ground truth masks.

Visualization of Results: The final stage involves visualizing the model’s predictions by overlaying the predicted masks onto the original images. This step helps to assess the model's accuracy and observe how well it segments the object regions.

This project provides a solid foundation for binary image segmentation tasks and can be extended with more complex models or additional segmentation classes for multi-class tasks.
